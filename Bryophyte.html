    The bryophytes show an alternation of generations between the independent gametophyte generation, which produces the sex
    organs and sperm and eggs, and the dependent sporophyte generation, which produces the spores. In contrast to vascular
    plants, the bryophyte sporophyte usually lacks a complex vascular system and produces only one spore-containing organ
    (sporangium) rather than many. Furthermore, the gametophyte generation of the bryophyte is usually perennial and
    photosynthetically independent of the sporophyte, which forms an intimate interconnection with the gametophytic tissue,
    especially at the base, or foot, of the sporophyte. In most vascular plants, however, the gametophyte is dependent on
    the sporophyte. In bryophytes the long-lived and conspicuous generation is the gametophyte, while in vascular plants it
    is the sporophyte. Structures resembling stems, roots, and leaves are found on the gametophore of bryophytes, while
    these structures are found on the sporophytes in the vascular plants. The sporophyte releases spores, from which the
    gametophytes ultimately develop.
